# hello-world
wait, what am I supposed to do?

ohhh, okay, write about myself

1. I am a person, some of the time

2. ... I'm really struggling here

3. I really enjoy writing bad code. I probably should never be a dev. If you're reading this, keep in mind that you should probably just ignore my pull requests :D
